# Numerical Computation on Stock Price Data

A simple attempt on Predicting and describing stock fluctuations in New York Stock Exchange on Python.

A couple of Simple methods such as polynomial Fitting, Spline Interpolation, Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression are examined.
Also, a method using RNN LSTMs is introduced for a more accurate and reliable prediction.

This toy project's main purpose is to give an introduction to data analysis on python, using packages such as *pandas* & *Sklearn*.
